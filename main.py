    Python Hints, Tips, Tricks

    Python is very top down, so if you need something it has to either be defined
        or imported above where you use it. (This differs from C#/Java)
    Python makes code blocks/scopes on indents. Typically you indent after a colon. (C#/Java uses curly braces)
    Python has 4 built in collections: List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary - know the differences in syntax and use.
