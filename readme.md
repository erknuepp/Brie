## Python Hints, Tips, Tricks

    1. Python is very top down, so if you need something it has to either be defined
        or imported above where you use it. (This differs from C#/Java)
    2. Python makes code blocks on indents. Typically you indent after a colon. (C#/Java uses curly braces)
    3. Python has 4 built in collections: List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary - know the differences in syntax and use.
    4. Understand OOO concepts
    5. Understand SOLID principles
